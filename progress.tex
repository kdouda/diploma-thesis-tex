\chapter{Current progress}

As of the time of the writing of this document, error detection based on simplistic rules is completely finished. Several outlines for the text part of the diploma thesis are also done, some are present in this document. Research into possible methods is also underway, with emphasis on HMMs and neural networks. Evaluating effectiveness of HMMs and CNN/LSTM NN for behaviour classification will be underway soon. A module for labeling sections of data for training and validation was added to the Anitra platform, and now a phase of data collecting is also underway. As the author is not an expert in animal movement and would introduce his layman biases to the data and thus bring down the possible end quality of the data, the author does not help in this phase.
